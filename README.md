# NewCX

A proof of concept (POC) of what a certain site (that hosts jobs for client companies) could look like if it followed tries to emulate what Apple does and applies modern UI animations, layout, etc.

The data used is mocked so no data actually comes from back-end. Essentially, this project is a more fleshed-out mock-up of a UX that can be hosted on a real server (with modifications).

StackBlitz: [TODO: add a link here :)]

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project and lint the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests.
